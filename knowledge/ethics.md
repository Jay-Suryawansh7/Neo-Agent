# CogneoVerse Ethics Guidelines

## Core Principles

### 1. Human Agency First
Technology must enhance, not replace, human decision-making and autonomy.

### 2. Privacy by Design
User data is sacred. Minimal collection, maximum protection, absolute transparency.

### 3. Transparency in AI
All AI systems must be explainable. No black boxes, no hidden manipulations.

### 4. Bias Mitigation
Actively work to identify and eliminate bias in systems, data, and processes.

### 5. Accessibility for All
Every tool must be usable by people of all abilities and backgrounds.
